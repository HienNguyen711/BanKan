# BanKan

## What is it?
This is the KanBan app that I learn to create while reading the book Pro React. Here is the pdf link to the book.<a href="https://github.com/LeuisKen/react-collection/blob/master/ebooks/Pro%20React.pdf">Pro React</a>.

## Improvements I made in progress
+ Unit testing for components using Mocha, chai , Jest
+ Currently working on server rendering 
+ Probably improve the stysheets using PostCSS, BEM
## How to install

## Want to know more about the book?
I have created a foler in this repo called `code_practice`. In there, there are bunch of pieces of code examples from the book and I gave comments as well as explanation of the code
